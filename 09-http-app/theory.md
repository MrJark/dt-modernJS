    You can also include filters in the URL by including additional query parameters. To start filtering add a ? followed by the query 'query'='value'. If you want to chain several queries in the same call, use & followed by the query.
    For example, If you want to check how many alive Ricks exist, just add ?name=rick&status=alive to the URL.

    Aviable parameters:
    1. name
    2. status -> ( alivd, dead, unknown)
    3. species
    4. type
    5. gender -> (female, male, genderless or unknown)
